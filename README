INSTALL
-------

If it's the first time you've run the app run the following in a Terminal window, in the project directory:

bundle
rake db:setup
rails server

#  visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

If you've already set up your database previously (above commands) and are just updating changes; in a Terminal window, in the project directory run:

bundle
rake db:migrate
rails server

#  visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser


Once your server is running, in a new Terminal tab in the project directory run:

compass -w

#  This will compile all the .scss files in app/stylesheets to .css files in public/stylesheets automatically.
