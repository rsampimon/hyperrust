<h3>Concert Review by Don Leary</h3>
<p>
Being from Northern California I've had some rare opportunities to              
see Neil in many various phases of his career.  A really special                
experience occurred on Monday,  October 13, 1986 when Neil & friends            
played an all-acoustic show for the Bridge School Benefit Pilot                 
Project.                                                                        
<p>                                                                                
The Project is a programme designed to help meet the needs of handicapped       
kids unable to communicate verbally.  Pegi Young is president of the project    
and was the driving force behind organizing the concert to help raise money     
for the Bridge School.                                                          
<p>                                                                                
The pre-concert atmosphere was electric and rumours of surprise guests          
ranged from the Eagles reforming to a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young            
reunion.  The few of us with seats close to the stage had views of              
David Crosby wandering around (and looking good), Joel Bernstein tuning         
what seemed like an army of guitars and just a sense of a moment                
that comes once in a lifetime.                                                  
<p>                                                                             
After a brief introduction by Pegi, Neil opened the show with <i>Comes            
A Time</i> and <i>Heart Of Gold.</i>  Then he brought out buddies, Bruce                
Springsteen and Nils Lofgren, to assist on  <i>Helpless</i> (which was not           
one of the better versions).  After an outstanding version of <i>I Am A           
Child,</i> Neil introduced an old member from Buffalo Springfield who              
brought a couple of friends along whom he'd met along the way.  Out             
walked Crosby, Stills & Nash to a thunderous ovation. 
<p>
Part-way through          
<i>Only Love Can Break Your Heart</i> tears swelled in my eyes, the beauty           
of seeing these four singing together again was just too much.  <i>Change         
Partners</i> was next, before Neil and Steve traded guitar riffs on                
<i>Daylight Again.</i>  Their set ended with an outstanding version of <i>Ohio</i>        
(with David screaming "How many more, how many more?").  The harmonies          
during their four song set were the best I've heard in years.                   
<p>                                                                             
Nils put on a short but good set which included <i>Keith Don't Go,               
Wonderland, Man At The Top,</i> and a song dedicated to Neil's son, Ben.         
<p>                                                                             
Don Henley was next and he brought one Eagle (Timothy Schmidt) &                
J.D. Souther, Danny Kortchmar and Jai Winding out with him. If you can          
get past his ego Don performed a very good set including <i>Boys Of               
Summer, Best Of My Love, New Kid In Town, Desperado, Yes It Is,</i>
and <i>You Don't Miss the Water 'til the Well Runs Dry.</i>  Don's  comment         
that playing on stage acoustically is like  "Standing here in a jockstrap       
and a pair of socks", proved that he is unaccustomed to doing non-electric sets.
<p>                                                                             
After a brief intermission, Tom Petty proved his inexperience at          
performing solo by doing an uneven set, in which his voice was often      
inaudible over his guitar.  The only song Tom did that stood out was      
the opening number, a version of <i>American Girl.</i>                         
<p>                                                                       
After a sidesplitting set by Robin Williams, the moment arrived for all   
the <b>Bruce!</b> fans in the audience. Neil came on to introduce Springsteen   
who immediately launched into an acapella version of <i>You Can Look But    
You Better Not Touch.</i>  After a soulful but weak version of <i>Born In The  
USA,</i> Bruce brought out Nils Lofgren and Danny Federci to assist him.     
The rest of the set was much stronger with Bruce and friends playing      
the following songs; <i>Seeds, Darlington County, Mansion On The Hill, 
Fire, Dancin' In The Dark, Glory Days</i> and <i>Follow That Dream</i>
(dedicated to Pegi and Neil).                                             
<p>                                                                       
Bruce then invited CSN&Y to join him on <i>Hungry Heart,</i> with Neil and     
Bruce sharing the same mike on the chorus.  The show ended with all the   
guests joining in on a rousing version of <i>Teach Your Children.</i>          
<p>                                                                       
All in all, it was an outstanding show for a very worthy cause.  See you  
in my next dream.
